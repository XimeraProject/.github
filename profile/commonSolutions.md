# Common Solutions to Student Issues

In this document we give several common problems that students may have when working with Ximera, and their solutions. 

## Ximera refreshes the page when submitting

This problem can be caused by several issues, each with a different solution:
* Problem: Poor internet connection  
  - Solution: Refresh the page immediately before entering each answer.
* Problem: Browser settings
  - Solution:  Try using a different browser.  Different students have reported luck with different browsers, including Edge, Firefox, and Chrome.
* Problem: Antivirus Software  
  - Solution: Some antivirus softwares (such as McAfree) are now blocking websockets, a technology Ximera relies on.  Try turning off the websockets setting on the antivirus
* Problem: VPN
  - Solution:  If you are using a VPN, try turning it off before using Ximera.

## Difficulty accessing Ximera
Most problems viewing or accessing Ximera are caused by browser settings.  The easiest solution is usually to try using a different browser.  Students seem to have the best luck with Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
* Be sure to access Ximera from a link in your Carmen course
* Open your Carmen course through a browser and not the Canvas App
* Do not create a Ximera account or log into Ximera.  You should be automatically logged in from Carmen.  If you are asked to log in, the connection to Carmen is broken.
* If Ximera is not being displayed correctly, try using a different browser.
* If the Ximera website displays a three digit error code, the website is having technical difficulties.  Wait a little while and try accessing the site again.  * You may want to screenshot the error code  in case you need to document your technical difficulties with your instructor.  


## Work not being recorded
This is almost always avoided by doing the following:
	1. Log in to Carmen. If you've already been logged in for more than 3 hours, log out of Carmen and log back in.
	2. Go to "Assignments"
	3. Click on the Ximera assignment. It should show you a button to load the assignment in a new window.
	4. You should be at your assignment, and if you look in the upper corner (at least on a computer) it should say your name.
	5. Do your work.
	6. Click save before you leave a page. (You don't need to worry about it unless you leave the page)
Your score will be submitted to Carmen within the hour.

## Math processing error
This is caused by an error in the browser setting. Two things to try:

### First possible solution:
* Clear browser cookies
* Close the browser.
* Open the browser and log in to Carmen.
* Go to the assignment.


### Second possible solution:
* Find one of the pages this is happening, 
* Put your mouse over the "math processing error"
* Now, "right-click" and select "accessibility" If collapsible math is checked, uncheck it.
* Reload the page.

## Using Ximera on an iPad
Be sure to access Ximera via Carmen using a browser such as Safari or Chrome
* If you are having trouble accessing the Math Editor, be sure you have updated your iPad software to the latest version.
* If you are having trouble with auto-capitalization in Ximera, you can:
* Hit shift twice before entering an answer to get a lower case letter.
* Turn off auto-capitalization on your iPad by going to Settings -> General -> Keyboards and toggling off auto-capitalization.
