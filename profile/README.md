# Welcome to the Ximera Project

Ximera, pronounced “chimera,” (**X**imera: **I**nteractive, **M**athematics,
**E**ducation, **R**esources, for **A**ll) is an open-source platform that
provides tools for authoring and publishing (PDF and Online),
open-source, interactive educational content, such as textbooks,
assessments, and online courses. **The ultimate goal of this project is
to promote sustained student success and savings.**


Ximera is built with authors, instructors, and students in mind. We
seek to provide an optimal work environment for all three types of
users.

## Authors

With Ximera, authors use LaTeX to create their content. With this
single source code, we generate different types of output:

![Ximera generates a PDF worksheet, an online interactive worksheet, and a PDF solution manual.](https://github.com/XimeraProject/.github/blob/main/profile/SimultaneousOutput.jpg "Single source code generates three different outputs.")

To get started as an author in Ximera, all you need is the XimeraLatex
LaTeX Package. Unfortunately, at this point, this package is not part
of CTAN. However, you can manually. Please feel free to contact Bart
Snapp with questions (snapp.14@osu.edu). Otherwise you can install the
package by

1. Getting a GitHub account
2. Going to: [https://github.com/XimeraProject/ximeraLatex](XimeraLaTeX on GitHub)
3. Clicking on the green code button: ![Click on the green code button.](https://github.com/XimeraProject/.github/blob/main/profile/codeButton.png "Click on the green code button.")
4. Copying: `git@github.com:XimeraProject/ximeraLatex.git`
5. Cloning the repository. 

At this point the installation becomes operating-system specific.

### Linux

If you are using running linux, create the local structure `~\texmf\tex\latex`

├── texmf
├───└── tex
└───────└── latex


### MacOS


### Windows



## Instructors

Instructors can use any Ximera text **without permission** from the
authors.
