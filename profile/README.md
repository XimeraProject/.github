# Welcome to the Ximera Project

Ximera, pronounced “chimera,” (**X**imera: **I**nteractive, **M**athematics,
**E**ducation, **R**esources, for **A**ll) is an open-source platform that
provides tools for authoring and publishing (PDF and Online),
open-source, interactive educational content, such as textbooks,
assessments, and online courses. **The ultimate goal of this project is
to promote sustained student success and savings.**


Ximera is built with authors, instructors, and students in mind. It is
our goal to provide an optimal work environment for all three types of
users.

## Authors

With Ximera, authors use LaTeX to create their content. With this
single source code, we generate different types of output:

![Ximera generates a PDF worksheet, an online interactive worksheet, and a PDF solution manual.](https://github.com/XimeraProject/.github/blob/main/profile/SimultaneousOutput.jpg "Single source code generates three different outputs.")
