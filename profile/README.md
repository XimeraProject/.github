# Welcome to the Ximera Project

Ximera, pronounced “chimera,” (**X**imera: **I**nteractive, **M**athematics,
**E**ducation, **R**esources, for **A**ll) is an open-source platform that
provides tools for authoring and publishing (PDF and Online),
open-source, interactive educational content, such as textbooks,
assessments, and online courses.
The Ximera Project is currently funded by U.S. Department of Education, through the [Open Textbooks Pilot Program](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/otp/index.html). The Ximera Project has also recieved support from NSF Grant DUE-1245433, the Shuttleworth Foundation, the Ohio State University Department of Mathematics, and the Affordable Learning Exchange at OSU.
 **The ultimate goal of this project is
to promote sustained student success and savings.** 


Ximera is built with authors, instructors, and students in mind. We
seek to provide an optimal work environment for all three types of
users.

## Authors

With Ximera, authors use LaTeX to create their content. With this
single source code, we generate different types of output:

![Ximera generates a PDF worksheet, an online interactive worksheet, and a PDF solution manual.](https://github.com/XimeraProject/.github/blob/main/profile/SimultaneousOutput.jpg "Single source code generates three different outputs.")

To get started as an author in Ximera, all you need is the XimeraLatex
LaTeX Package. Unfortunately, at this point, this package is not part
of CTAN. However, you can find instructions for manual installation at the [XimeraLaTeX repository](https://github.com/XimeraProject/ximeraLatex#readme).
Please feel free to contact Bart
Snapp (`snapp.14@osu.edu`) with questions. 



## Instructors

Instructors can use any Ximera content **without permission** from the
authors.
