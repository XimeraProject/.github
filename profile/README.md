# Welcome to the Ximera Project

Ximera, pronounced “chimera,” (**X**imera: **I**nteractive, **M**athematics,
**E**ducation, **R**esources, for **A**ll) is an open-source platform that
provides tools for authoring and publishing (PDF and Online),
open-source, interactive educational content, such as textbooks,
assessments, and online courses.
The Ximera Project is currently funded by U.S. Department of Education, through the [Open Textbooks Pilot Program](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/otp/index.html). The Ximera Project has also recieved support from NSF Grant DUE-1245433, the Shuttleworth Foundation, the Ohio State University Department of Mathematics, and the Affordable Learning Exchange at OSU.
 **The ultimate goal of this project is
to promote sustained student success and savings.** 


Ximera is built with authors, instructors, and students in mind. We
seek to provide an optimal work environment for all three types of
users.

## Authors

With Ximera, authors use LaTeX to create their content. With this
single source code, we generate different types of output:

![Ximera generates a PDF worksheet, an online interactive worksheet, and a PDF solution manual.](https://github.com/XimeraProject/.github/blob/main/profile/SimultaneousOutput.jpg "Single source code generates three different outputs.")

To get started as an author in Ximera, all you need is the XimeraLaTeX
LaTeX Package. Unfortunately, at this point, this package is not part
of CTAN. However, you can find instructions for manual installation at the [XimeraLaTeX repository](https://github.com/XimeraProject/ximeraLatex#readme).
Please feel free to contact `ximera@math.osu.edu`) with questions. 


### Online Deployment

Once you have some content, you will probably want to see how it works
online. Currently, we only deploy from a single server. As part of our
work, we seek to make this process seamless.



## Instructors

Instructors (who are not authors) can freely use any Ximera materials,
**without permission**, simply by using the the URL of the
course. Here is an incomplete list of Ximera courses that have been
deployed online (authors, please feel free to add your course!)

* [Calculus 1 at OSU](https://ximera.osu.edu/mooculus/calculus1)
* [Calculus 2 at OSU](https://ximera.osu.edu/mooculus/calculus2)
* [Calculus 3 at OSU](https://ximera.osu.edu/mooculus/calculus3)




If an instructor experiences issues with the content or performance of the materials, there are simple ways to report these issues. 


![Buttons that link to GitHub issues.](https://github.com/XimeraProject/.github/blob/main/profile/getHelp.png "Buttons for help.")

Morever, here is a list of [common solutions for student issues](https://github.com/XimeraProject/.github/blob/main/profile/commonSolutions.md).


The instructor experience falls into three basic categories:


### Online Materials with LMS Integration 

At OSU and UF, instructors of large classes and a few others have
Ximera assignments directly integrated into the Learning Management
System (LMS). For these
instructors, Ximera works seamlessly and invisibly.


### Online Materials without LMS Integration 

At other institutions using Ximera, instructors can use Ximera
materials, and have their students complete various Ximera
assignments.  However, data access prohibitively difficult for most
instructors in this category. **We are currently working on finding a
solution that will provide grade data for all Ximera instructors.**


### PDF Materials 

There are a number of Ximera courses that are not yet deployed online.
Their materials are currently only in PDF form. Instructors in this
category are usually in a development phase of their Ximera
course. The PDFs produced allow incremental development of the
materials while still being used and tested in the classroom. See:

* [Abstract Algebra I]()
* [Advanced Geometry]()
* [Math for Architects]()
* [Math for Teachers]()
* [History of Mathematics]()
* [Business Calculus]()
* [Linear Algebra and Differential Equations]()




## Students

Ximera materials are free. Students can use any of the materials they
find, even if the student is not enrolled in a course. We hope that
authors can use our materials to make the very best possible learning
experience for students.
