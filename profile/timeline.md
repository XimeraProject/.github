- Programmers need to be hired
- Online deployment is most critical. Potential authors want
to see their work deployed online.
- We need a application for stipends. This could be done in a  survey.
  - Name
  - Email
  - Institution
  - Brief description of planned work
- We also need a follow up, where the grantee gives
  - Name
  - Email
  - Institution
  - Brief description of work done
  - Link to artifact of work
  - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfKXtp9vRoGfh_TI0FNKB9uwFtcQmKl57nwEGoUz-QCsb3SIQ/viewform?usp=sf_link
- Met with Andrew Maier to discuss accessibility.
  - OSU is requiring a degree of accessibility for all PhD Thesis.
  - https://github.com/AndyClifton/accessibility
  - https://libguides.lib.msu.edu/c.php?g=995742&p=8207771
  - The situation for PDF accessibility seems dire. The smart
	people on stack exchange do not have a good solution. 		
- Making github site: https://github.com/XimeraProject more reasonable.
- Applied for a Minicourse at MathFest, see Week 32.
- Xourse files, do we compile course files?
- Maybe these could be compiled in the repo, as they are just lists of activities.
- Evaluators need to be hired.
- When do announcements need to go out for the 
  - Stipends?
  - Evaluators?
  - Programmer?
- Need to add courses to https://github.com/XimeraProject
- Need to add "Releases" to PDF only ximera courses
- Add math and music as PDF only
- Got the Project Profile document (Due 12/31/2023 - Week 0)
- According to https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202301/rnoti-p68.pdf tex4ht is still good.
# Week -7: 11/6/2023 - 11/10/2023
- Working on making github site: https://github.com/XimeraProject more
reasonable by ensuring that PDF's are created for releases. Make
"releases" for various ximera courses. Include READMEs
- See https://github.com/mooculus/mathForArchitects
- Emailed times to meet program director.
- Fowler and Snapp discussed, accessibility / tex4ht 
The issue is that \answer is fundamentally incompatible with tex4ht
- Met with DoeNet group -- 
- Grade book course markdown mock-up
```
# DOENET Course 
- An arbitrary course name
## End Date
- 12/31/2026
## Description
- Blah for Math is a course that is team taught at Happy and Sad View High Schools. 
## Instructor
- Jane Doe
- John Mak
## Institution 
- Happy View High School
- Sad View High School
# Assignments
- [Prelecture](https://ximera.osu.edu/mooculus/calculus1/understandingFunctions/breakGround)
- [Graphing Assignment 1](https://www.desmos.com/calculator)
- [HW 2](https://www.geogebra.org)
- [EC](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=YOUR_PLAYLIST_ID)
- [HW 5](https://www.geogebra.org/classic)
```
- The End Date would give us a time when we could email the instructor letting them know that we plan to delete/archive the course data. However, we might retain record of the course for evaluation purposes. The Description, Instructor, and Institution(s) are, I think essentially irrelevant, EXCEPT for the fact that when we email students, and create courses pages (which could just be the markdown above!) we will be assuring the student that they are in the right place to do their homework.
- Do assignments need release dates? Can they be added at a later
  date? Maybe so... If they can simply be added to DoeNet.md file
  after it's been submitted, that might work!
- **Issues** We need a way of describing EXACTLY which assignments are
  part of a "column" in a gradebook. The path of the URL could be used
  to do this (any assignment with the same starting path is part of
  the column) BUT we also need ways of grouping assignments into a
  single column.
### A potential instructor (say a HS teacher) 
- Makes an account
- Uploads a (possibly pre-made) DOENET.md file
- Gets an email with a code (option to resend required)
- sends code to students (with list of student emails)
### Students
- login with email and code.
- Click on buttons, goto links get grades. 
### Instructors retrieve grades
- login to gradebook
- select course
- make database query (we can have predefined ones)
  E.G. Graphing Assignment 1, up to 10/30/24 13:34pm EST
- Retrieve a spreadsheet
- Return grade data to students through traditional methods.
